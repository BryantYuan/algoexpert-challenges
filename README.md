## Solutions

The solutions are all in the program.py files. However, if you would like an explanation or a hint(s) got to the solution.md

## Forks

If you want to fork this project (and please do), there is an option for you to clear out all the program.py. This way you can write the code yourself with all the test programs working, without having to delete all of my solutions in the current files.

To do that just run: `clearSolutions.py`

## Note

In each challenge directories resource folder, you will find a 'give_program'. Please _**ignore**_ this file. This file was created by me to produce all the testcase json files that you can see in each challenge. However, if by some mistake there is no testcases, just run the command under **_'Produce Testcase'_** in each challenge.md.
